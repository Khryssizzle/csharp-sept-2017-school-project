# csharp-sept-2017-school-project
 The aim of this project is to help users keep track of personal belongings that they lend out.
 
 There are no special instructions to run this program. Just clone to Visual Studio and run. 
 
 In the future I would like to add a separate class for borrowers and add them to a drop down menu in the create entry form. I would also  like to add radio buttons for item types. (I tried, but couldn't figure out how to get the database to populate them...yet.)I would also like to add a section that keeps track of borrowers and the total number of items they are borrowing. Maybe a few icons or different card colors based on item types or how long the item has been borrowed. I would also like to add a SMS feature that notifies you when a borrowed item is due.
